- [x] inverse solve for non-spd matrix (safe early fallback + dedicated non-SPD p=1 suite)
- [x] solve_inverse ideas ablation (non-SPD p=1, one-factor-at-a-time)
- [ ] non-SPD p=1: reduce hard-case safe fallback latency toward Torch-Solve
- [ ] non-SPD p=1: investigate/guard against unstable precondition choices (frob, conservative coeff safety)
- [ ] SPD p=1 path: reduce gap vs Torch-Cholesky-Solve exact baseline
